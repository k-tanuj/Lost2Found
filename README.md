# 🔍 Lost2Found – Turning Lost Items into Found Belongings

A **Google-powered, AI-assisted Campus Lost & Found Platform** built for hackathons and beginners.  
Lost2Found helps students and staff report lost items, upload found items, and intelligently match them using AI — all with **free-tier tools**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In colleges and campuses:
- Lost items are announced manually
- No centralized system exists
- Matching lost & found items is slow and unreliable

**Lost2Found** solves this by providing a **single digital platform** where:
- Users report lost or found items
- AI helps match items using images & text
- Google technologies power search, storage, and intelligence

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Build a **simple, scalable campus lost & found system**
- Use **Google technologies (free tier only)**
- Keep the project **beginner-friendly**
- Make it **hackathon-ready in 2 days**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📝 Report Lost Items (with image + description)
- 📦 Upload Found Items
- 🤖 AI-based Image & Text Matching
- 🔍 Smart Search using Google APIs
- 🔐 Secure Authentication
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI

---

## 🧠 How the System Works (Traditional Flow)

1. User logs in
2. User reports a **lost** or **found** item
3. Image + text is stored in the database
4. AI compares new entries with existing ones
5. Possible matches are suggested
6. User connects with the finder/owner
